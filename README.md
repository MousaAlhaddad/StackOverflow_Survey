# StackOverflow_Survey
I am a graduate from a medical school who codes primarily as a hobby, and I always wanted to know how many coders are like me. Thus, I decided to look for this group of programmers in the 2019 Stack Overflow Annual Developer Survey which which obtained nearly 90,000 responses from developers from over than 170 countries.
 
## Data 
The data can be easily downloaded from this [link](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey) in a CSV format. 

## Jupyter NoteBook 
The [notebook](StackOverflow.ipynb) uses Python version 3.7 and contains the wangling and analyzing steps as well as the results. 

## Results 
### 1. What is the percentage of developers who have a major in health science? 
The percentage of developers who have a health major is 0.43%.
### 2. What are the salary averages of developers with a health science major and the rest of the developers?
The mean annual salaries for health major developers is around 192,000 USD which is higher than the 134,000 USD for developers with no health major.
### 3. Which programming or scripting languages do health science major developers want to work in over the next year?
The most wanted programming languages for the next year are Java, JavaScript, C#, Python, R, and C.
