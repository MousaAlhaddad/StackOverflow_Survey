# StackOverflow_Survey
I am a graduate from a medical school who codes primarily as a hobby, and I always wanted to know how many coders are like me. Thus, I decided to look for this group of programmers in the 2019 Stack Overflow Annual Developer Survey which which obtained nearly 90,000 responses from developers from over than 170 countries.
